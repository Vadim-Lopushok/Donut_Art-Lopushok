            <p class="popup__text popup__text--color--sand">Is there such a thing as the perfect doughnut? The delicate,
              plain-glazed beauties we've been sneaking from Hero Doughnuts in Birmingham make a strong case.
              These doughnuts remind you that sometimes a plain glazed is so much more than a plain glazed. Marrying
              classic taste and feel with sophisticated modern technique, the result is the best of all possible
              worlds.</p>
            <p class="popup__text popup__text--color--sand">There is a school of thought that says overstuffing a ball
              of fried dough with chocolate cream is probably plenty, that a quick dusting of confectioner's sugar is
              plenty—something simple, ever so slightly demure.
              Hand-cut and generously proportioned, this doughnut is a master class on the topic. For the final,
              over-the-top flourish, the thing is essentially drowned in a sugar glaze. Contact us directly to find out
              more details or give us a good recommendation!</p>

            <p class="popup__text popup__text--color--bread">There is much to be said about Southern California's
              Sidecar Donuts & Coffee, which started out in a Costa Mesa strip mall, just a short ride from the pier in
              Newport Beach, but we'll start with the cake doughnuts. There are some excellent ones out there, but few
              more elegant than the brilliantly simple butter and salt doughnut made here throughout the day. The
              country is plagued with overpriced designer doughnut shops these days, where cute toppings and the bells
              and whistles are designed to distract us. With a doughnut like the butter and salt at Sidecar, no
              distraction is needed. These are as straightforward as doughnuts come, perfectly fried every time,
              remarkably delicate, made of vanilla bean cake, kissed with a brown butter glaze and fleur de sel.
              Looks-wise, it might have come from a classic bakery in the Midwest. Taste-wise and quality-wise, there's
              almost none better in its class.</p>

              with these to die for donut recipes the moment you taste them! I sure was!
              I was always someone who bought their donuts at the store, but that was before I learned how easy and how
              much better donuts are when you make them at home. There really is no comparison.In this section we

            <p>It is difficult to imagine our life without shopping. On one hand, it’s one of quite important household
              tasks. Moreover, shopping is the way to get necessary food and clothes. So, if you don’t do it you can’t
              have all things which make your life so comfortable.</p>

            <h3>Design center</h3>
            <p>At the heart of Design Centre, Chelsea Harbour, the Design Club is a private members’ club for people in
              the design and creative industries.
              Work is now more flexible than ever before. Become a member of the Design Club to enjoy access to a
              convivial space that’s the ideal base for sourcing, meetings or some quiet time with a laptop – all just
              steps from the showrooms. Working patterns were already becoming increasingly nomadic before 2020, but
              this year, how we work has changed for good. Many small businesses have given up their offices and are
              seeking a hybrid solution where they mix home-working with a friendly, professional external hub. Based at
              Design Centre, Chelsea Harbour, and with a membership base of like-minded people in the creative
              industries, the Design Club fills that gap.</p>

            <h3>Point to people in trouble</h3>
            <p>There is a Chinese saying that goes: “If you want happiness for an hour, take a nap. If you want
              happiness for a day, go fishing. If you want happiness for a year, inherit a fortune. If you want
              happiness for a lifetime, help somebody.” For centuries, the greatest thinkers have suggested the same
              thing: Happiness is found in helping others.</p>
