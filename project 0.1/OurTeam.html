              Ana Roš
            </h2>
            <p class="worker-card__text">
              Ana Roš is also a self-taught chef, from Hiša Franko, who’s achieved great things since accidentally
              taking
              over the kitchen at the family-owned restaurant in Slovenia in her 20s. From competitive skier to almost
              diplomat, she’s since dedicated nearly two decades to the culinary trade, earning her place among the
              world’s best cooks and being voted World’s Best Female Chef in 2017.
            </p>
            <p class="worker-card__text">
              From the outside, it would appear a picture-perfect lifestyle in the cosy family restaurant set in the
              rural
              Soča Valley. But managing a family, a business, a creative kitchen and generally being an ambassador for
              Slovenian gastronomy abroad hasn’t all been plain sailing: “I have experienced very difficult moments,
              some
              decisions about my career have been difficult to take,” she explains.</p>

              Margarita Forés
            </h2>
            <p class="worker-card__text">
              Italophile, Philippine chef Margarita Forés learnt her culinary trade overseas, in her youth from
              “Signoras”
              in Italy. Despite stumbling across her love of cooking by chance, she is also happy to look back, with a
              successful restaurant portfolio and culinary school, and say, “30 years down the road, this is my
              reality.”
            </p>
            <p class="worker-card__text">
              Forés hails from a country with what she calls a “maternal society” where women hold influential positions
              of power. She’s also excited by an industry that is becoming so much more inclusive, she describes the
              “wonderful synergy” that both genders bring to the kitchen making the industry so much more vibrant and
              relevant.</p>

              Annie Féolde
            </h2>
            <p class="worker-card__text">
              Self-taught French-born Annie Féolde, chef/owner of Enoteca Pinchiorri in Florence, entered the kitchen by
              chance in her early 20s, before it catapulted her into a hugely successful lifelong career, a career that
              began with helping out her sommelier husband in his Italian enoteca’s kitchen and resulted in her being
              the
              first female chef in Italy to attain three Michelin stars.
            </p>
            <p class="worker-card__text">
              An inspiring self-determination and dedication to a career meant she “stayed 20 years in the kitchen,
              reading books at night and working in the kitchen during the day.” However she recommends young female
              chefs
              to adopt a more orthodox approach to training, by adapting to the habits of the kitchen by starting young:
              “Learn the basics in schools, training in restaurants and understand if you are really interested in the
              trade,” she says.
